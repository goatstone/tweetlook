gostart
==============

Gostart is a starter application based on Golang, HTML and CSS and runs on Google App Engine.

I often encounter situations in which I will need to perform a standard web task that is needed in order to support other tasks at hand. Having the ability to implement these tasks in a timely manner is important to maintaining the main application development.  

Gostart is a general purpose, web site code base with some standard functionality.
Currently there is support for  HTML form request/response style data input and editing.
Application logging and template usage is also supported.
Support for JSON output, generation and consumption will probably be the next addition.

Gostart currently relies on Google App Engine for some application functionality such as login. Through the GAE control panel, datastore values can be controlled. Perhaps, most importantly GAE also provides an environment in which code can be easily edited and deployed to a scalable production environment.
